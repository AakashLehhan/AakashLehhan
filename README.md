# Hi there! 👋

I'm Aakash, a **Software Engineer** by profession and a passionate **nature and farming enthusiast**. When I’m not diving into code, you’ll likely find me working in my garden, exploring the outdoors, or experimenting with sustainable farming methods.

## A bit more about me:
- 🌱 Growing marigolds, bonsai plants, and always exploring more about organic farming.
- 🖥️ Experienced in web development, product testing, and building Power BI reports.
- 🛠️ Skilled in Java, Python, SQL, and more.
- 🌍 Based in the scenic **Himachal Pradesh**, which inspires my love for nature.
